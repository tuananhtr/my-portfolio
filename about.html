            <p>
                My professional journey spans seven years in <strong>Business Consulting</strong>  and <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, primarily within the <strong>Fintech</strong> and <strong>E-commerce</strong> sectors. I have worked on translating complex datasets into actionable strategies for high-growth environments. Navigating these fast-paced industries taught me how to effectively bridge the gap between technical analysis and business goals, ensuring that I use data science to solve real-world problems rather than just theoretical ones.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a <strong>Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science</strong> at <strong>KU Leuven</strong>. I love the rigorous statistical methods I am learning in the program and applying them to the practical challenges I faced in my career. This combination of industry experience and academic depth allows me to approach data problems with both agility and precision.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between mental rigor and physical activity. I love playing badminton and running, which help me clear my mind after diving deep into data. Music is my creative outlet, and I love playing guitar whenever I have free time to unwind and find a different kind of rhythm.
